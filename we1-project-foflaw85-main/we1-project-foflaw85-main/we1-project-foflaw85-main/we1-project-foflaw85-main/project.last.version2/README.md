> Hello!
my name is Fatima Awad, in the ”web utveckling 1”WE1 course.
The project summary:
My goal is to know the principles of code and the web. When I started the project, my goal was to create a website for a lawyer. But my information as a lawyer is few in Sweden. Therefore, I changed the project to a personal blog.
in which I display information about me and my family, my work, contact information, and some distinctive photos in the gallery. 
Project Steps and content:
-1 So I have created four pages in the menu which are Home, About , Gallery, Contact.
2-Each file has its own CSS.
3- Each file has its own basic elements, head, body, div, header and footer. 
4- projects language is English. 
5- I used same CSS,  same colors, fonts for all pages, same header and footer.
6- On the home page, I added information about me, pictures, and a form element on the main element to contact me via messages.
7- On the About Me page, add two cards containing two articles, one about me and my children, and one about me as a lawyer, and it contains” a element”link to a PowerPoint containing detailed information about the lawyer in Syria. 
8- In the gallery , I displayed 15 distinctive images, and there was a target link so that the image could be displayed in full size, and I also added the “div images hover” to know which image to scroll over. All images have the same format.
9- On the contact page, there is all the contact information, the address in detail, the phone, and the email. 
In the main element I put my social media with the link to access it directly from the site”<li>”
Projects problems :
I had problems that made the project take longer, including that changing the CSS in one file must be changed in all other files. It would have been better to create a CSS page for all files via the tag.
Because I missed working lessons for the project, I was unable to use the GitHub website at the beginning, so I had a lot of duplicate files. This made a mess to get to the latest version, but I was able to put the last version in one file under the title of “project.last.version2”.
The problem that I encountered at the beginning was that the images did not display in many pages because they were not in the same folder or because the name did not match, and I solved this problem by putting all the images and attachments in one folder and writing the names in the code carefully. 
Project budget. The project took me a long time because I changed the idea first and changed all the CSS and elements . And because I wanted to be the best in every version until I was satisfied. Some of the sessions were very long at the beginning until I was able to find out everything and solve the problems.
On average, I used to sit every day for more than 3 hours, and at the weekend , the long sessions were up to 13 hours.

The project is not limited by specific information or formatting, so it can be developed more and more, whether by adding more elements and pages, or taking care of the details of the presentation in CSS, and this I am still working on until the last day of presenting the project.
Thank you for your interest in my project!
