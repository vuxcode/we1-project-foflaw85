<p> Hello!
My name is Fatima Awad, I am 38 years old, married and have two children.
I have a law degree from Damascus University and worked as a lawyer for 8 years ago, with various criminal cases.
In addition, I also have some experience working as a teacher, so I taught children at different elementary levels and different subjects.
It taught me in a pedagogical way, to handle children and young people in different circumstances as well.
As a person, I am social, helpful, patient and love working with children</p>
